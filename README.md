## 🚀 Overview

A real-time monitoring dashboard that visualizes global wildfire activity using satellite data.  
This project leverages NASA’s EONET (Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker) API to provide up-to-date information on active fire events across the globe.

This application fetches live data directly from NASA's servers. It's designed for researchers, environmentalists, or anyone curious about global fire patterns.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> Due to the massive scale of the NASA dataset, the initial load may take a few seconds.  
> If the data doesn't appear immediately, the API might be under heavy load — please refresh or try again in a few minutes.
