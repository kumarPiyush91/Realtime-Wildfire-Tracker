# Realtime-Wildfire-Tracker

🔥 Wildfire Tracker
A real-time monitoring dashboard that visualizes global wildfire activity using satellite data. This project leverages NASA’s EONET (Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker) API to provide up-to-date information on active fire events across the globe.

🚀 Overview
This application fetches live data directly from NASA's servers. It's designed for researchers, environmentalists, or anyone curious about global fire patterns.

[!NOTE]

Data Loading: Due to the massive scale of the NASA dataset, the initial load may take a few seconds. If the data doesn't appear immediately, the API might be under heavy load—please refresh or try again in a few minutes.

✨ Features
Live Data: Direct integration with NASA's EONET API.

Interactive UI: Clean JSX-based structure (CSS enhancements in progress).

Real-time Tracking: Visual representation of fire events globally.

🛠️ Tech Stack
